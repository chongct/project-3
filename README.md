My group is developing an online business directory and networking platform
to help small scale local businesses / individuals,
to solve the problem of a lack in popularity to the general public
by creating a community to foster collaboration between small scale businesses.

Our site also aims to feature products which are not commonly found which differentiates us from other e-commerce sites.
eg. an individual specialize in making christmas related handicraft can choose to partner with a neighbourhood cake shop selling christmas log cakes during the christmas festive season through the site we are building

## User stories

* As an owner of a small physical shop / individual renting a box space / individual selling at a flea market or push cart, I want to collaborate and partner with other sellers so that I can increase the range of products I am selling and in the process, earn a commission by featuring other sellers' products.

* As an individual selling items on a part time basis through the web, I want to be able to show case my products by partnering with businesses having a physical shop front so that more customers are able to view my products physically before buying them. I am also able to increase my sales by advertising through more channels.

* As an entrepreneur / owner of a small business, I want to be able to reach out to more customers so that more people are aware of the items which I am selling.

* As a buyer, I want to be able to have a site which features and provides information on products which are not commonly found.

* As a buyer of online goods, I want to be able to view the products I am interested in physically before buying them so that I can ensure that I am satisfied with the quality of the products. This can be done by visiting shops, rented box spaces, flea markets or push carts which will be featuring them.

* As a buyer of online goods, I want to be able to access the catalogues and be updated of the items sold at small physical shops, rented box spaces, flea markets or push carts so that I can make the decision first before visiting them.
